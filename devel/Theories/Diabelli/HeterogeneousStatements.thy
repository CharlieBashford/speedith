(* Lemma 1: If we have formula A' that is entailed by a premise A, and B'
  entails the conclusion B, then by proving A' \<Longrightarrow> B', we also prove A \<Longrightarrow> B. *)
lemma assumes en1: "A \<Longrightarrow> A'" and en2: "B' \<Longrightarrow> B" and new: "A' \<Longrightarrow> B'"
      shows old: "A \<Longrightarrow> B"

(* Lemma 2: If we have a goal G to prove, and we know that G' \<Longrightarrow> G, can we
    then prove G by just proving G'? *)
lemma assumes en1: "G' \<Longrightarrow> G" and new: "G'"
      shows "G"
