ERR_SORTED_SETS_COMPARATORS_DIFFER=The comparators in the two given sorted sets differ. The comparators should be the same.
ERR_SORTED_SETS_NO_COMPARATOR=The given sorted sets do not have comparators.
ERR_PARSE_INVALID_SYNTAX=Could not parse the spider diagram. Invalid syntax.
GERR_NULL_ARGUMENT=The argument '%s' must not be null.
ERR_UNKNOWN_SD_TYPE=Could not convert the abstract syntax tree into a spider diagram. Stumbled upon an unknown language element.
ERR_TRANSLATE_UNEXPECTED_ELEMENT=Stumbled upon an unexpected element in the spider diagram description. Expected: %s
TRANSLATE_KEY_VALUE_PAIR=key = value
ERR_TRANSLATE_MISSING_ELEMENTS=Translation failed. Could not find some of the mandatory elements: %s
GERR_ILLEGAL_STATE=Speedith has experienced an unexpected predicament. Please report the error to the development team.
ERR_TRANSLATE_INVALID_STRING=Could not convert to string. The element is either not a string or is malformed.
ERR_TRANSLATE_LIST_OR_SLIST=a list
ERR_TRANSLATE_INVALID_ID=Could not extract the identifier name. The element is not a valid identifier.
ERR_TRANSLATE_UNEXPECTED_KEY_VALUE=The attribute '%s' is not allowed here. Expecting one of the following: %s
ERR_ARGUMENT_ALL_NULL=At least one of the arguments must be non-null.
GERR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT=Argument '%s' has an illegal value.
ERR_TRANSLATE_ZONE=Invalid zone description.
ERR_TRANSLATE_TOO_MANY_ELMNTS=Too many elements.
ERR_TRANSLATE_ELEMENTS_COUNT=Invalid number of elements. Expected %d found %d.
ERR_TRANSLATION_EXCEPTION_MSG=The translation of the spider diagram failed with the following reason: '%s', at line %d character %d.
ERR_TRANSLATION_EXCEPTION_MSG_NO_POSITION=The translation of the spider diagram failed with the following reason: '%s'
ISABELE_EXPORT_DESCRIPTION=Exports spider diagrams to Isabelle 2011 formulae.
ERR_EXPORT_PROVIDER_CLASS=The given class could not have been registered as an export provider.
ERR_PROVIDER_SCAN_FAILED=Scan for export providers failed.
ERR_OPERATOR_NOT_KNOWN=The operator '%s' is not known.
ERR_WRONG_NUMBER_OF_OPERANDS=Wrong number of operands for operator '%s'. Expected %d, got %d.
ERR_OPERAND_NULL=All operands must be valid spider diagrams.
ERR_TRANSLATE_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTES=Found unexpected attributes in the nary spider diagram definition: '%s'.
ERR_EXPORT_INVALID_SD=Cannot export invalid spider diagram.
ISABELE_EXPORT_PAR_USE_X_SYMBOLS_DESCRIPTION=Value of this parameter can be either 'true' or 'false'. It indicates whether the exporter should use X symbols or normal ASCII names (for operators).
ERR_ISAEXPORT_ARG_COUNT_INVALID=Expected an infix operator (with at least two operands). The actual number of operands: %d.
ERR_SD_HABITATS_WITHOUT_SPIDERS=A primary diagram specifies some spider habitats but it contains no spiders.
ERR_SETS_NOT_NATURALLY_ORDERED=Cannot use the natural order of elements because the sets use a custom order.
GERR_EMPTY_ARGUMENT=The argument '%s' must not be null or empty.
ERR_NULL_ZONE_IN_REGION=The set of zones for the region must not contain 'null' zones.
RULE_NO_SUBGOALS=Cannot apply the rule on no subgoals.
RULE_INVALID_ARGS=Unknown parameters to the inference rule.
GERR_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS=The index is out of bounds.
GERR_ILLEGAL_STATE_EXPLANATION=Speedith has experienced an unexpected predicament. %s Please report the error to the development team.
ERR_PRIMARY_SD_EQUALS_NON_PRIMARY_SD=A primary spider diagram erroneously equals to a non-primary spider diagram.
ERR_COMPOUND_SD_EQUALS_NON_COMPOUND_SD=A compound spider diagram erroneously equals to a non-compound spider diagram.
GERR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_EXPLANATION=Argument '%s' has an illegal value. %s
ARGUMENT_MUST_BE_NON_NEGATIVE=Argument must be non-negative.
ERR_SPLIT_SPIDERS_INVALID_REGION=The split habitat is not the spider's proper (non-empty and not equal) sub-habitat.
ERR_SPIDER_NOT_IN_DIAGRAM=Cannot set the spider's habitat. The spider '%s' is not in the diagram.
SPLIT_SPIDERS_DESCRIPTION=This rule splits a spider's habitat into two regions. A single unitary diagram is transformed into a compound diagram with two disjunctively connected unitary diagrams. These two unitary diagrams represent two cases: i) either the spider is in the first region, or ii) the spider is in the second region.
ERR_READING_INVALID_REGION=Could not read the string. It is not a valid region.
RULE_SUBGOAL_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE=The chosen subgoal does not exist. Subgoal index '%d' is out of range.
RULE_NO_SUBGOAL_AT_INDEX=The subgoal at index '%d' is 'null'. This is invalid behaviour and should be reported as a bug.
