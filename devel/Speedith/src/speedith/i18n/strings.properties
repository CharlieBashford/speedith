CLI_ARG_DESCRIPTION_LIR=Prints a list of available spider-diagrammatic inference rules. It also prints the required arguments to the inference rules (if any).
CLI_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SDI=The 'sub-diagram index'. This option tells the selected inference rule which sub-diagram to target in its operation.
CLI_ARG_SDI_VALUE_NAME=index
CLI_ARG_DESCRIPTION_SP=The 'spider name'. This option tells the inference rule which spider to target.
CLI_ARG_SP_VALUE_NAME=name
CLI_ARG_DESCRIPTION_R=The 'region'. This option tells the inference rule what region to use (if the inference rule requires it). This string should be formatted in the following way: [(["A", "B"], []), (["C"], ["D", "E"])]

CSD_PANEL_INVALID_LAYOUT=The compound spider diagram panel supports only the grid bag layout.
CSD_PANEL_NO_DIAGRAM=No diagram.
APP_UNKNOWN_INFERENCE_RULE=The specified inference rule is not known. Please specify a valid inference rule with the '-ir' command-line parameter.
APP_NO_INFERENCE_RULE=No inference rule was specified. Please specify an inference rule to apply to the spider diagram. For a list of available inference rules use the '-lir' command line argument.
APP_UNKNOWN_EXPORTER=Cannot export the spider diagram because the exporting format is unknown. Please specify a valid export format with the '-of' command line argument. For a list of known export formats use the '-lof' command line argument.
