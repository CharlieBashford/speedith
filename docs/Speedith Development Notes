# Building & Developing Speedith

## Building and developing using IDEs

Another way to build and develop Speedith is to install either
[NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/downloads/) or the
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) IDEs.

Download one of the following:

*   the Java SE version of NetBeans.
*   the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, or

> Development of Speedith is done in __NetBeans__, which is the easiest way to get
> started with development of Speedith. Eclipse is currently not supported out of
> the box, but there is no technical reason why it would not work (importing the
> Speedith's source folder should do the trick).

## Requirements

These requirements have to be checked only once. After you make sure you have
these, you can build Speedith at any time.

*   __Speedith sources__: You can get the sources of Speedith from
    [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/speedith).

    You may simply want to execute this in the command line:

            git clone git://gitorious.org/speedith/speedith.git speedith
            cd speedith

*   __iCircles sources__: You can get the sources of iCircles from
    [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/speedith/inductive_circles).

    You may simply want to execute this in the command line:

            git clone git://gitorious.org/speedith/inductive_circles.git inductive_circles
            cd inductive_circles

*   __Apache Ant__: Speedith can be built with [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
    (which is a Java-based build automation tool, similar to `make`). The
    minimum required version of Ant can be determined by running:

            grep 'antversion atleast=' devel/Speedith/nbproject/build-impl.xml

    You can install Ant via your operating system's package management system,
    or by downloading it from [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).

    Make sure that the `ant` executable is available from the command line in
    the root folder of Speedith (or make sure that you know where the `ant`
    executable is located).

    You can check your version of Ant by running:

            ant -version

*   __ANTLRv3__: Speedith uses the
    _[ANTLRv3 Java Runtime](http://www.antlr.org/download.html)_ for parsing the
    textual representation of spider diagrams.

    One way of getting ANTLRv3:

            wget 'http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.3.tar.gz'
            tar -xzf antlr-3.3.tar.gz

    There should be the `./antlr-3.3/runtime/Java/target/antlr-runtime-3.3.jar` 
    file, which is the runtime library dependency required by Speedith. Also
    needed by Speedith is the `antlr-3.3/lib/antlr-3.3-complete.jar` file, which
    is needed only during the compilation stage (not a runtime dependency).

*   __Apache Commons CLI__: Speedith uses [Apache Commons CLI](http://commons.apache.org/cli/)
    for command line parsing. You can download the library from [here](http://commons.apache.org/cli/download_cli.cgi).

    An example of how to get it with `wget`:

            wget 'http://mirror.lividpenguin.com/pub/apache//commons/cli/binaries/commons-cli-1.2-bin.tar.gz'
            tar -xzf commons-cli-1.2-bin.tar.gz

    The `./commons-cli-1.2/commons-cli-1.2.jar` is the file we're after.

## Manual build process

__Note__: the instructions below assume the following:

*   the _current working directory_ is the __root of the Speedith repository__.
*   the `ant` executable is in your `PATH` environment variable.
*   the _iCircles_ sources are reachable via the `../inductive_circles` path
    from the root of the Speedith repository.
*   you know the paths of `antlr-3.3-complete.jar`, `antlr-runtime-3.3.jar` and
    `commons-cli-1.2.jar` files (the instructions will use dummy paths).

Follow these steps:

1.  Being in the repository's root folder, run:

            ../apache-ant-1.8.2/bin/ant --noconfig \
                -Dlibs.ANTLRv3.classpath=/home/test/Downloads/antlr-3.3/runtime/Java/target/antlr-runtime-3.3.jar \
                -Dantlr3.tool.jar=/home/test/Downloads/antlr-3.3/lib/antlr-3.3-complete.jar \
                -Dlibs.JakartaCLI.classpath=/home/test/Downloads/commons-cli-1.2/commons-cli-1.2.jar \
                -f devel/Speedith/build.xml
